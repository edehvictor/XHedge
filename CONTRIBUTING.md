## 📝 Commit Guidelines (Strict)

We follow a strict **Modular Commit** philosophy to ensure history is readable and revertible.

**The Golden Rule:**
> "Commit after every meaningful change, not every line."

*   **Meaningful Change:** Completing a function, finishing a fix, adding a feature block, creating a file, or making a significant modification.
*   **Avoid:** Micro-commits for single-line edits unless they are standalone fixes.
*   **Frequency:** Commit often, but only when you finish a logical piece of work.

### Example Commit Messages
*   `feat(contract): implement yield allocation logic`
*   `fix(ui): correct risk visualization chart`
*   `docs: update fx data source list`

5.  **Commit**: Follow the commit guidelines above.

## 🔗 Pull Request Checklist

When opening a PR, follow these steps:

1.  **Link the Issue**: In your PR description, use:
    - `Closes #26` — when your PR resolves the issue
    - `Fixes #26` — when your PR fixes a bug
    - `Resolves #26` — when your PR fully resolves it
    Example:
    ```
    ## Summary
    - Added detailed event logging for AI analysis
    
    Closes #26
    ```

2.  **Tag Both Issue & PR**: 
    - On the **issue**: Comment tagging the author (`@username`) to let them know you're working on it
    - On the **PR**: Tag `@maintainer` to notify maintainer(s) review is ready
    Example on issue:
    > Hey @maintainer, I've got a PR ready for this. Want to check it out when you get a chance?
    Example on PR comment:
    > @maintainer, PR is ready for review!

3.  **Keep PRs Small**: Only fix what's needed. Don't rewrite entire files or change hundreds of lines when the issue only needs a few lines fixed. Real devs fix the specific problem, not everything.
